# [Statie.org](https://www.statie.org) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/crazko/statie-web.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/crazko/statie-web)

This is the documentation site for [Statie](https://github.com/Symplify/Statie), the PHP static site generator.

## Contributing

Open an issue or, better, fork this repository, make changes and send a pull request. Thank you!

## See your changes

Build the site locally:

*   be sure you have [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) installed
*   install dependencies (currently only Statie) `composer install`
*   generate the site from the source `vendor/bin/statie generate source`
*   run local PHP server `php -S localhost:8000 -t output`
*   open [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser.

## Enable live reload

You can get rid of hitting refresh on every change you made and see your changes instantly with the use of the [Browsersync](https://www.browsersync.io/):

*   be sure you have [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/) with **npm** installed
*   install dependencies `npm install`
*   run `npm run gulp`
*   it should run [specified tasks](https://github.com/crazko/statie-web/blob/master/gulpfile.js) and open a new window in your browser, typically at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). If not, just open it.

Now the site updates on every change in the source files.

_Note: you don't need to have local PHP server running._
